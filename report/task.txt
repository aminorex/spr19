supwsd:
4 tests, 2 training with 2 tests each (dev + test)
train on small.xml in pytorch-pretrained-bert/bodies
then train on train.xml

data:
google wsd corpus (github) - word sense disambiguation corpora
+ data from supwsd (OMSTI+SemCor+WSDEval)
concat all
take 3/1000 as test, 8/1000 as dev, 20% of remainder used for small case training (scaling up if possible)
